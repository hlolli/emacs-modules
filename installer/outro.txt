WARNING: This will disable (not remove!) all your personal emacs configuration
by moveing your ~/.emacs.d (if exists) to ~/original-emacs-d

After the installation is over, you can safely move back the parts that you need
from your original-emacs-d to the newly created ~/.emacs.d

Note that files starting with a dot (like .emacs.d) wont be visible on some systems
you may need to enable 'Show Hidden Files and Folders' or similar setting to see
the directory.
